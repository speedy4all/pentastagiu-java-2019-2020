Write a program that will sum up all numbers from 0 up to a target number.

For example, for an input number 5, result should be 15 (0+1+2+3+4+5)

Write a program that will calculate the average and sum of all numbers between the range of 2 numbers.

For example, for range numbers 1 to 100 output should be:


Sum for range 1 to 100 : 5050

Average for range 1 to 100 : 50.0


Write a program that will print the first x fibonacci numbers. Also calculate the average value. For example
For an input of x = 20 the output should be:
The first 20 Fibonacci numbers are:
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 2584 4181 6765
The average is 885.5

Write a java program that will test whether the first and the last element of an int array are the same. We can assume the array has 2 or more elements.
For example:
For the following input [13,6,2,8,2,3] the output should be : FALSE
For the following input [13,6,2,8,2,13] the output should be : TRUE

Write a program that test whether 2 int arrays are equal. Equality in this case means that both arrays have the same number of elements an element on a specific index in first array is equal to the element on the same index in the second array.
For example
For the following arrays [1,2,3,4] and [1,2,3,4] the output should be TRUE
For the following arrays [] and [] the output should be TRUE
For the following arrays [1,3,2] and [1,3] the output should be FALSE
For the following arrays [1,2,3,4] and [1,2,4,3] the output should be FALSE

Write a java program that will concatenate 2 arrays.
For example
Given 2 arrays [1,2,3,4] and [5,6,7,8] the output should be a new array containing [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]


Write a java program that will return the min, max and average values in a given array.
For example
GIven the following array [13,20,14,5,2,8] the output should be
Max : 20
Min : 2
Average: 10.3

Write a java program to return the index of a target element.
For example:
Given  the following array [13,20,14,5,2,8] and a target element 5 the output should be : 3 (because 5 is located at index 3 in the array)

Write a Java program to find the number of even and odd integers in a given array of integers
For example.
Given the following array [13,20,14,5,2,8] the output should be:
Odd elements count : 2
Even elements count : 4

Write a program that test if a given String contains another String.
For example
Given the following base String “Hello java world” and the target test String “java” the output should be TRUE


Write a program that will count how many times a character appears in a String
For example
Given the string “Hello java world” and the target character ‘a’ the output should be 2
(since ‘a’ appears twice in “Hello java world”)


Write a program that will test whether a string ends with another string


For example

Given the following strings “Hello java world” and “orld” the output should be TRUE




Write a program that will return a different string representing the alphabet index of each letter.


Assuming we have the following alphabet encoding


a = 0

b = 1

c = 2

d = 3

…


For the given string “abcd” the output should be “0123”

Write a program that will insert a # between any duplicate letters that are placed right next to each.

For example


Given the following string “Hello world” the output should be “Hel#lo world”

Write a program to test whether a given string is a palindrome or not


For example

Given the following string “aaabccbaaa” should return TRUE

Given the following string “abccbb” should return FALSE
