Create a console application from the following requirements:
In the application we will work with few things: cars, phones, smart refrigerators. Add some specific details for each one
We want each of these things to be able to connect with bluetooth → write a Connectable interface in which you specify this contract: a method called connectToBluetooth
Add another simple class, Student for example, which doesn’t have to implement the Connectable interface
Implement this contract in each class that you have and add a specific implementation(in which you just print to console a message in which you specify: “Connect to bluetooth in progress...” and the name of the device)
