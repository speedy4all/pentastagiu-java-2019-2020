Make a List of Circle objects. Use a random radius. Keep adding circles to the list until Math.random() returns less than 0.01. Then, loop down the list and print out each area.
Note: To generate a random number use the following:
double rand = Math.random();
To generate a random integer number in a range use:
(int)(Math.random*100);
