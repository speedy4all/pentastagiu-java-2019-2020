Create a console application from the following requirements:
We plan to create a strategy game: in this game we will have characters and artifacts
Each artifact will have a position on the map(x and y) and a number of extra points. We will have 2 types of artifacts: health artifact and energy artifact
Each character can be a human, a monster or an animal; each one will have a name, a number of health points, a number of energy points and a position on the map (x and y); for each one we will have the method that gives us the position on the map and also a method that will receive as parameter an artifact and will increase the number of health points or energy points of the character with the number of extra points given by the artifact, depending on the type of artifact that is passed as parameter
Some of the characters will have the ability of attacking other characters:
Humans can attack: in which case they will waste 5 energy points and the character that is attacked will lose 10 health points
Monsters can attack: in which case they will lose 3 energy points and the character that is attacked will lose 15
Use a scenario in which you create few artifacts, few characters(one of each type), play with the objects from the game and display at the end the status for each characters
For extra functionality, you can add validation logic(for example if someone attacks a character that doesn’t have enough health points a message is displayed that the character attacked is already dead) or logic related to the position on the map(you will consider a 10 per 10 map and when attacking a character, verify first the distance of the current character to the attacker it’s smaller than 5 and only in that case initiate the attack)

Scenario for testing:
Create a Human, a Monster and an Animal, each one with a position on the map decided by you and 50 health points and 20 energy points
Make the human attack the animal
Make the monster attack the human
Make the human attack the monster
Make the human use an energy artifact that you create
….
Display info about the status of each character in the game
