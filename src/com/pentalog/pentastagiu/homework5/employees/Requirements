Suppose you have a Map of employees, where the key is their age and the value is their name sorted in alphabetical order. Write a Java program that:
Declares and initializes the map
Adds values to it
Add values for a key that is not yet present in the map
Iterate over the map’s keySet and prints the name of the employes for that key
Iterate over the map’s entrySet and displays the first person alphabetically
